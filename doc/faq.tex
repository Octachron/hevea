\section*{Conventions}
Throughout this document. We assume that your \LaTeX{} document is
\texttt{doc.tex} and that you have a \hevea{}-targetted style file
\texttt{doc.hva}. That is, you run \hevea{} by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
# hevea doc.hva doc.tex
\end{verbatim}

\section{How do I include Postscript images~?}\label{image}
Images in web pages usually are in other formats than Postcript.
For instance in GIF format.

Assume that you have a Postscript file \texttt{image.ps},
which is included in your document \texttt{doc.tex} by~:
\begin{verbatim}
\epsfbox{image.ps}
\end{verbatim}

A first solution is for you to translate the Postscript file by hand
into a GIF file, say
\texttt{image.ps.gif}.
Then you will have to tell \hevea{} to include a link to the GIF file
instead of the Postcript one.
Just add this command to \texttt{doc.hva} file.
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\epsfbox}[1]{\imgsrc{#1.gif}}
\end{verbatim}
Note that sometimes, the Postscript file has been produced by
translating a GIF file. In this case, this simple method is the most
adequate, since
translating an image from GIF to Postcript and back to GIF will degrade it.


However, the translation can be done automatically, usually at the
price of a lower image quality, by using the \textit{image} file
facility.
Just put this definition into the \texttt{doc.hva} file~:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\epsfbox}[1]{%
\begin{toimage}
\epsfbox{#1}
\end{toimage}%
\imageflush}
\end{verbatim}
Then run \hevea{} and \texttt{imagen} as follows~:
\begin{verbatim}
# hevea doc.hva
# imagen doc
\end{verbatim}
