Subject: hevea bug: commented macro

Thank you for hevea!  I have tried a few tools for LaTeX to html and find
it the best.

This is a real example from our actual books that is crashing.

I noticed it seems to parse macros after %, but it usually does not cause
an error.  Sometimes it does.

Here is the Minimum Working Example:

\documentclass[11pt]{book}

\begin{document}
WORKS:

\textit{
 The following ...
 }

BREAKS:

 \textit{
%\textbf{
 The following ...
 }

\end{document}

???
