It is my pleasure to anounce the new release of HEVEA.

      This is HEVEA, version 1.03, a fast LaTeX to HTML translator.


    HEVEA is a LaTeX to HTML translator.  The input language is a fairly
    complete subset of LaTeX2e (old LaTeX style is also accepted) and the
    output language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
    version 3.2.

    With respect to previous version 1.02, the most salient changes
    are:
       - Style files now have the ``.hva'' extension (instead of
        ``.sty'').
        The compatibility file for LaTeX gets renamed into
       ``hevea.sty''

       - Packages ifthen, calc, array and tabularx are implemented.

       - The ``snippet'' construct by Christian Queinnec,
         (Christian.Queinnec@lip6.fr) for typesetting source code is
         implemented.
         (cf http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/VideoC/VideoC.html)

       - The imagen scripts accepts a few options that enable
         altering the default behavior of .GIF images generation.

       - Some of HEVEA internal commands are documented.
       
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Exotic symbols are translated into symbols
    pertaining to the symbol font of the HTML browser, using the
    non-standard FACE attribute of the FONT tag.
    This allows the translation to HTML of quite a lot of the symbols
    used in LaTeX.

    HEVEA understands LaTeX macro definitions. Simple user style
    files are understood with little or no modifications.
    Furthermore, HEVEA customization is done by writing LaTeX code.
    
    HEVEA is written in Objective Caml, as many lexers. It is quite fast
    and flexible. Using HEVEA it is possible to translate large documents
    such as manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are
    translated as one single HTML file. Then, the output file can be cut
    into smaller files, using the companion program HACHA.
