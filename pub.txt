It is my pleasure to anounce the new, 1.05, release of HEVEA.


    HEVEA is a LaTeX to HTML translator.  The input language is a fairly
    complete subset of LaTeX2e (old LaTeX style is also accepted) and the
    output language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
    version 4.0 (transitional)

    With respect to previous version 1.04, there are numerous changes.

      - New functionalities, such as multicolumn indexes, enhanced color
        management.

      - \usepackage is implemented and a package system has been
         designed. Some packages such as color, graphics, url,
         moreverb etc. are supported.

      - Hyperlink command names are changed, to avoid a long-standing
        name clash on ``\url''. Backward compatibilty is ensured in
        most of the cases.

      - HeVeA no longer needs ``.aux'' files to compute
        cross-referencing information and a new ``-fix'' makes HeVeA
        iterate until fixpoint 

      - HeVeA code is cleaner than before.



       
                 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Exotic symbols are translated into symbols
    pertaining to the symbol font of the HTML browser, using the
    now standard FACE attribute of the FONT tag.
    This allows the translation to HTML of quite a lot of the symbols
    used in LaTeX.

    HEVEA understands LaTeX macro definitions. Simple user style
    files are understood with little or no modifications.
    Furthermore, HEVEA customization is done by writing LaTeX code.
    
    HEVEA is written in Objective Caml, as many lexers. It is quite fast
    and flexible. Using HEVEA it is possible to translate large documents
    such as manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are
    translated as one single HTML file. Then, the output file can be cut
    into smaller files, using the companion program HACHA.
