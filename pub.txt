It is my pleasure to anounce the new, 1.09, release of HEVEA.

    HEVEA is a LaTeX to HTML translator.  The input language is a
    fairly complete subset of LaTeX2e and the output
    language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
    version 4.0 (transitional)

    HEVEA web page is <http://hevea.inria.fr/>


With respect to previous version 1.08, there are numerous changes,
including :

   * Added packages,
        ifpdf, chngcntr, inputenc (support for latin 8 bit encodings)
        eurosym, textcomp, longtable, supertabular.

   * A long standing misfeature is now  corrected
     (you can now put \title{...} after \begin{document})

   * On the HTML side, CSS usage have been extended and
     paragraphs are now translated with P elements.


WARNING
  To compile hevea 1.09, you need ocaml 3.07.

  Thanks to Ph. Viton. the (compiled) windows version 1.09  is
  available
  <http://facweb.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/pviton/support/winport.html>

  Packagers for various Linux distributions
  will update their packages at their convenience.
