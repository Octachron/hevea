INSTALLATION

  REQUIRMENTS
          Hevea is written in Objective Caml (Ocaml). It compiles under
        OCaml 1.07, which should thus be properly installed.  Ocaml is
        available at
          ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/ocaml-1.07.tar.gz

        More information on OCaml can be found at
          http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/

        Hevea is fully functionnal when other software are installed
          * A modern LaTeX installation including dvips.
          * The ghoscript Postcript interpreter.
          * the netpbm image processing package.
             ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM
        However, these softwares are optionnal and hevea runs without them.

CONFIGURATION
        There are a few configuration variables at the beginning of
        the Makefile.
          * TARGET

            TARGET= opt makes hevea compile under ocamlopt, the
            Objective Caml compiler that produces native code. This is
            the default.

            TARGET=byte makes hevea compile under ocamc, the
            Objective Caml compiler that produces bytecode.

            Using opt, hevea is about three times as fast than
            using byte. However, some OCaml installations may only
            provide ocamlc.

          * LIBDIR is the library  directory of hevea, that contains
            hevea style files. It defaults to /usr/local/lib/hevea.

          * BINDIR is the directory where to install, hevea, hacha and
            imagen. It defaults to /usr/local/bin.

          * CPP is cpp, it defaults to ``gcc -E -P -x c''.
        

MAKE
        Once configuration variables are set, type:
        make ; make install
